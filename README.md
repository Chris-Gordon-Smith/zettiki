# Zettiki

**Zettiki** is an open-source project focused on developing tools for exploring and publishing concept maps and knowledge graphs.

Zettiki aims to support structured note-taking, research synthesis, and interconnected thinking — making it easier to "navigate a web of knowledge."

Zettiki is based on the **Zettelkasten** method — a way of recording and structuring knowledge by writing short, linked notes.

Zettiki draws on [org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/), which implements this approach for Emacs users using plain-text files. Zettiki uses org-roam data to generate static, interconnected maps that can be browsed locally or published to the web.

The project may grow to include additional tools and components. Tts core ideas are already in use by the author and may later be released as modular open-source packages.
